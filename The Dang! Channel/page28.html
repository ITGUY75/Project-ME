<h3 style="text-align:center">The Page of Dang!</h3>
<p>This page will consist of what is going on with the channel, like updates and all that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating this page was thought of by me and only me, I hope you enjoy your stay while checking out this cool website.</p>
<p>The Dang! Channel is my channel. This channel was a cool idea, I have a cool vision of what I want to do with this channel, it has been a dream of mine to make this channel more better. I hope it continues to get better.</p>
<p>This channel consists of videos I have made since May 2, 2012. These videos on this channel are family homemade videos, movie montages, channel IDs and other stuff. I will continue to make these videos in the future whenever I can.</p>
<p>I would like this channel to become a TV channel.</p>
<p>This channel was started on May 2, 2012 on You Tube.</p>
<p>Let's make this happen!</p>

<p>Everyone has ideas. My idea became this. My name is Daniel. I have always enjoyed creative things. I'm glad I did this page and made my channel. My background has always involved trial and error, I learned and I will keep on learning.</p>
<p>I will never get up on this. I love videos, I will always love trying new things.</p>
