<h3 style="text-align:center">The Page of Dang!</h3>
<p>This page will consist of what is going on with the channel, like updates and all that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating this page was thought of by me and only me, I hope you enjoy your stay while checking out this cool website.</p>
<p>The Dang! Channel is my channel. This channel was a cool idea, I have a cool vision of what I want to do with this channel, it has been a dream of mine to make this channel more better. I hope it continues to get better.</p>
<p>This channel consists of videos I have made since May 2, 2012. These videos on this channel are family homemade videos, movie montages, channel IDs and other stuff. I will continue to make these videos in the future whenever I can.</p>
<p>I would like this channel to become a TV channel.</p>
<p>This channel was started on May 2, 2012 on You Tube.</p>
<p>Let's make this happen!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">A Brief Summary of the Creator</h3>

<p>My name is Daniel. I got into video editing around 2011, it started small with slide shows with music, then it became more about videos and other stuff. My background has always involved trial and error, I learned and I will keep on learning.</p>
<p>I will never give up on this.</p>
